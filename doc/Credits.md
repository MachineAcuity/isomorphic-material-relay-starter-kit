This project serves as a starter kit for projects utilizing the following technologies:

* [React JS](https://facebook.github.io/react/)
* [Relay / GrpahQL](https://facebook.github.io/relay/)
* [Isomorphic Relay](https://github.com/denvned/isomorphic-relay)
* [Material-UI](http://www.material-ui.com/)
* [Java Web Tokens](https://jwt.io/)

It contains a boilerplate with several simple code examples. It consists of modified versions of the following projects:

* [Facebook Relay Starter Kit TODO example](https://github.com/facebook/relay/tree/master/examples/todo). Implementation of the TODO MVC using Relay. In this kit the TODO example has been re-implemented with material UI.
* [Isomorphic react-router-relay TODO example](https://github.com/denvned/isomorphic-relay-router/tree/master/examples/todo). The Facebook TODO example in this project has been modified to support isomorphism.
* [Xpepermint's isomorphic-react-relay-boilerplate](https://github.com/xpepermint/isomorphic-react-relay-boilerplate). The project organization was initially borrowed from this project, although it has since diverged.
* [coryhouse's react-slingshot](https://github.com/coryhouse/react-slingshot). Ideas about he documentation are borrowed from this project.
* [ryancole's league](https://github.com/ryancole/league). The organization of the GraphQL schema is borrowed from this project.
