This project serves as a starter kit for projects utilizing the following technologies:

* [React JS](https://facebook.github.io/react/)
* [Relay / GrpahQL](https://facebook.github.io/relay/)
* [Isomorphic Relay](https://github.com/denvned/isomorphic-relay)
* [Material-UI](http://www.material-ui.com/)

It contains a boilerplate with several simple code examples. It consists of modified versions of the following projects:

* [Facebook Relay Starter Kit TODO example](https://github.com/facebook/relay/tree/master/examples/todo). Implementation of the TODO MVC using Relay.
* [Isomorphic react-router-relay TODO example](https://github.com/denvned/isomorphic-relay-router/tree/master/examples/todo). The Facebook TODO example in this project has been modified to support isomorphism.
* [Xpepermint's isomorphic-react-relay-boilerplate](https://github.com/xpepermint/isomorphic-react-relay-boilerplate). The project organization is largely borrowed from this project.

Examples from other projects have also been incorporated.
